# Full Stack Projects
This repository contains the projects with full-stack applications along with backend codes using AI and ML.

## Project:1 Predictive Maintenance & Sustainable Development

This project aims to create a dashboard to predict the failure modes of a CNC milling machine based on the data collected from sensors. Along with that, it also shows the carbon footprint generated by the machine. The objective is to minimize maintenance costs and promote sustainable manufacturing.
